[scadnano](http://scadnano.org) ("scriptable-cadnano") is a program for designing synthetic DNA structures such as DNA origami. 
The scadnano Python package 
([source code repository here](https://github.com/UC-Davis-molecular-computing/scadnano-python-package)) 
is a library for programmatically creating and editing these nanostructures.
The scadnano project is developed and maintained by the UC Davis Molecular Computing group.
Note that [cadnano](https://cadnano.org) is a separate project, developed and maintained by the [Douglas lab](https://bionano.ucsf.edu/) at UCSF.

## Overview

This package is used to write Python scripts outputting `.sc` files readable by [scadnano](https://scadnano.org), a web application useful for displaying and manually editing these structures. The purpose of this module is to help automate some of the task of creating DNA designs, as well as making large-scale changes to them that are easier to describe programmatically than to do by hand in the scadnano web interface.

We will try to announce breaking changes (and possibly new features) under the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/UC-Davis-molecular-computing/scadnano-python-package/releases). The version numbers in this Python library repo and the [web interface repo](https://github.com/UC-Davis-molecular-computing/scadnano/releases) won't always advance at the same time, and sometimes a feature is supported in one before the other.

Following [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), version numbers are major.minor.patch, i.e., version 0.9.2 has minor version number 9. Prior to version 1.0.0, when a breaking change is made, this will increment the minor version (for example, going from 0.9.4 to 0.10.0). After version 1.0.0, breaking changes will increment the major version.





## Reporting issues

Please report issues in the web interface at the [scadnano web interface GitHub repository](https://github.com/UC-Davis-molecular-computing/scadnano/issues), and report issues in the Python scripting library at the [scadnano Python package GitHub repository](https://github.com/UC-Davis-molecular-computing/scadnano-python-package/issues).






## Installation

Short version: type this at the command line:

```console
pip install scadnano
```

Read below for troubleshooting suggestions if that didn't work.

### Getting Python
The scadnano Python package requires Python version 3.9 or later.

To check your current version of Python, open a command line and type

```
python --version
```

If it is version 2.7 or below, type

```
python3 --version
```

If that fails, or reports Python version 3.8 or below, you will have to install a later version of Python. Follow [this link](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to install Python. You may also use an alternative Python distribution, such as [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads).



### Installing the scadnano Python package

Once Python is installed, there are two ways you can install the scadnano Python package:

1. pip (recommended)

    Use [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) to install the package by executing the following at the command line:
    ```console
    pip install scadnano
    ```

    If it worked, you should be able to open a Python interpreter and import the scadnano module:

    ```console
    Python 3.7.9 (default, Aug 31 2020, 17:10:11) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)] :: Anaconda, Inc. on win32
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> import scadnano as sc
    >>> print(sc.Domain(helix=1, forward=True, start=0, end=8))
    Domain(, helix=1, forward=True, start=0, end=8)
    >>>
    ```

    ### Troubleshooting
    If the above does not work for you, here are some things to try.

    If your Python installation does not already have pip installed, you may have to install it. 
    Executing [this Python script](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) should work; 
    see also 
    https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html 
    or 
    https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/install-pip-windows/.

    Once pip is installed, or if you believe it is already installed, check your version of `pip` by typing 
    ```
    pip --version
    ```
    It should say something like 
    ```
    pip 19.3.1 from ...lib\site-packages\pip (python 3.8)
    ```
    If the version of Python at the end is Python 3.9 or higher, you are good. If it is version 2.7 or lower, type
    ```
    pip3 --version
    ```
    If that works and shows Python 3.9 or higher, you are good, but you should type `pip3` in the subsequent instructions instead of `pip`.

    
2. download

    As a simple alternative (in case you run into trouble using pip), you can simply download the scadnano.py file. However, you need to first install two packages that are required by scadnano: Install [openpyxl](https://pypi.org/project/openpyxl/) and [tabulate](https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/) by typing the following at the command line: `pip install openpyxl tabulate`.
    
    Download and place the following files in your [PYTHONPATH](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#envvar-PYTHONPATH) (e.g., in the same directory as the scripts you are running). **Note:** If you are reading this on the PyPI website or anywhere other than GitHub, the links below won't work. They are relative links intended to be read on the [GitHub README page](https://github.com/UC-Davis-molecular-computing/scadnano-python-package#readme).

    - *required*: [scadnano.py](scadnano/scadnano.py) 
    - *optional*: [modifications.py](scadnano/modifications.py); This contains some common DNA modifications such as biotin and Cy3. 
    - *optional*: [origami_rectangle.py](scadnano/origami_rectangle.py); This can help create origami rectangles, but it is not necessary to use scadnano.
    
    To download them, right-click on "Raw" near the top and select (in Chrome or Firefox) "Save link as...":

    The scadnano package uses the Python package [xlwt](https://pypi.org/project/xlwt/) to write Excel files, so xlwt must be installed in order to call the method [`Design.write_idt_plate_excel_file()`](https://scadnano-python-package.readthedocs.io/#scadnano.Design.write_idt_plate_excel_file) to export an Excel file with DNA sequences. To install xlwt, type `pip install xlwt` at the command line. (If you instead use pip to install the scadnano package, xlwt will be automatically installed.)







## Example

Consider the following design:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UC-Davis-molecular-computing/scadnano/master/doc-images/screenshot-initial.png)

The following Python script produces this design.

```python
import scadnano as sc
import modifications as mod


def create_design() -> sc.Design:
    # helices
    helices = [sc.Helix(max_offset=48), sc.Helix(max_offset=48)]

    # left staple
    stap_left_domain1 = sc.Domain(helix=1, forward=True, start=8, end=24)
    stap_left_domain0 = sc.Domain(helix=0, forward=False, start=8, end=24)
    stap_left = sc.Strand(domains=[stap_left_domain1, stap_left_domain0])

    # right staple
    stap_right_domain0 = sc.Domain(helix=0, forward=False, start=24, end=40)
    stap_right_domain1 = sc.Domain(helix=1, forward=True, start=24, end=40)
    stap_right = sc.Strand(domains=[stap_right_domain0, stap_right_domain1])
    stap_right.set_modification_5p(mod.biotin_5p)

    # scaffold
    scaf_domain1_left = sc.Domain(helix=1, forward=False, start=8, end=24)
    scaf_domain0 = sc.Domain(helix=0, forward=True, start=8, end=40)
    loopout = sc.Loopout(length=3)
    scaf_domain1_right = sc.Domain(helix=1, forward=False, start=24, end=40)
    scaf = sc.Strand(domains=[scaf_domain1_left, scaf_domain0, loopout, scaf_domain1_right], is_scaffold=True)

    # whole design
    design = sc.Design(helices=helices, strands=[scaf, stap_left, stap_right], grid=sc.square)

    # deletions and insertions added to design are added to both strands on a helix
    design.add_deletion(helix=1, offset=20)
    design.add_insertion(helix=0, offset=14, length=1)
    design.add_insertion(helix=0, offset=26, length=2)

    # also assigns complement to strands other than scaf bound to it
    design.assign_dna(scaf, 'AACGT' * 18)

    return design


if __name__ == '__main__':
    design = create_design()
    design.write_scadnano_file(directory='output_designs')
```

Running the code above produces a `.sc` file that, if loaded into scadnano, should appear as in the screenshot above. The [web interface README](https://github.com/UC-Davis-molecular-computing/scadnano/blob/master/README.md#terminology) explains many of the terms used in the code (domain, helix, loopout, insertion, etc.).


## Abbreviated syntax with chained methods
Instead of explicitly creating variables and objects representing each domain in each strand, there is a shorter syntax using chained method calls. Instead of the above, create only the helices first, then create the Design. Then strands can be added using a shorter syntax, to describe how to draw the strand starting at the 5' end and moving to the 3' end. The following is a modified version of the above `create_design` function using these chained methods:

```python
def create_design() -> sc.Design:
    # helices
    helices = [sc.Helix(max_offset=48), sc.Helix(max_offset=48)]

    # whole design
    design = sc.Design(helices=helices, grid=sc.square)

    # for absolute offsets, call method "to"
    # left staple
    design.draw_strand(1, 8).to(24).cross(0).to(8)

    # for relative offsets, call method "move"
    # right staple
    design.draw_strand(0, 40).move(-16).cross(1).move(16).with_modification_5p(mod.biotin_5p)

    # scaffold
    design.draw_strand(1, 24).move(-16).cross(0).move(32).loopout(1, 3).move(-16).as_scaffold()

    # deletions and insertions added to design are added to both strands on a helix
    design.add_deletion(helix=1, offset=20)
    design.add_insertion(helix=0, offset=14, length=1)
    design.add_insertion(helix=0, offset=26, length=2)

    # also assigns complement to strands other than scaf bound to it
    design.assign_dna(design.scaffold, 'AACGT' * 18)

    return design
```

Documentation is available in the [API docs](https://scadnano-python-package.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#scadnano.Design.draw_strand).


## StrandBuilder object for iteratively building up strands with many domains

The method [`Design.draw_strand`](https://scadnano-python-package.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#scadnano.Design.draw_strand), as well as all those that follow it in a chained method call (e.g., `move`, `cross`, etc.) all return an instance of the class [`StrandBuilder`](https://scadnano-python-package.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#scadnano.StrandBuilder).
Above, that `StrandBuilder` instance is anonymous, i.e., never assigned to a variable. 
Some long strands may be easier to specify with loops, for example an M13 scaffold strand for an origami. 
If so, then to use the above methods, assign the `StrandBuilder` object to a variable, and call the relevant methods on that object to build up the strand in each iteration of the loop. 
For example, the following modification of the above `create_design` function creates a linear scaffold strand that zig-zags back and forth across 32 helices:

```python
def create_design() -> sc.Design:
    num_helices = 32
    helices = [sc.Helix(max_offset=200) for _ in range(num_helices)]
    design = sc.Design(helices=helices, grid=sc.square)
    strand_builder = design.draw_strand(0, 0)
    for helix in range(num_helices):
        # move forward if on an even helix, otherwise move in reverse
        move_distance = 200 if helix % 2 == 0 else -200
        strand_builder.move(move_distance)
        if helix < 31: # crossover to next helix, unless it's the last helix
            strand_builder.cross(helix + 1)
    strand_builder.as_scaffold()
    return design
```
